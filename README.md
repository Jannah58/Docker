🚀 Getting Started
Once everything is set up, follow these steps to launch the application:

1️⃣ Start the Application
Run the following command from the root directory:

👉docker-compose up
This will build and start both the frontend and backend containers.

2️⃣ Access the Website
Open your browser and navigate to:

👉 http://localhost:3000

If everything is running correctly, you’ll see your React app live!

🛠️ Notes
Make sure Docker is installed and running on your machine.

If you make changes to the frontend code, you may need to rebuild:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up --build
